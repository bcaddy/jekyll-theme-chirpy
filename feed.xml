Meetings and Summer School The OLCF User Meeting was this week and the Rensselaer Summer Program: Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Training for Modeling Physical Systems summer school started. This week was the bootcamp that just went over some basic computational skills. </summary> </entry> <entry><title>CUDA Training</title><link href="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-Training/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CUDA Training" /><published>2021-06-18T15:43:02-04:00</published> <updated>2021-06-18T15:43:02-04:00</updated> <id>https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-Training/</id> <content src="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-Training/" /> <author> <name>Robert Caddy</name> </author> <category term="CUDA" /> <summary> Learning CUDA I completed five more sections of the OLCF CUDA Training Series, which leaves me with just one more that I’ll finish off next week. Testing I contacted several other Frontier CAAR teams and have been talking about their testing frameworks with them. I also met with Alwin to discuss testing. </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Learning Cuda and GPU Resident MPI</title><link href="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-and-MPI-GPU/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning Cuda and GPU Resident MPI" /><published>2021-06-11T16:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-06-11T16:00:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-and-MPI-GPU/</id> <content src="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/CUDA-and-MPI-GPU/" /> <author> <name>Robert Caddy</name> </author> <category term="CUDA" /> <summary> GPU MPI I started on getting GPU resident MPI working on the Pitt CRC cluster. So far it compiles but doesn’t run. I’m working with the CRC and other group members to get that fixed. I got access to Summit and other OLCF systems this week so after getting setup there and familarizing myself with the systems I worked on getting MPI GPU to work there. After several hurdles and with help I got it ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cholla Prep</title><link href="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/Cholla-Prep/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cholla Prep" /><published>2021-05-28T16:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2021-05-28T16:00:00-04:00</updated> <id>https://robertcaddy.com/posts/Cholla-Prep/</id> <content src="https://robertcaddy.com/posts/Cholla-Prep/" /> <author> <name>Robert Caddy</name> </author> <category term="MHD" /> <category term="Cholla" /> <summary> MHD Debugging I spent some more time bug hunting and found that the instability only shows up when a number is not exactly expressible in binary. After discussin this with Evan they pointed out that it could just be an artifact of turning a 3D algorithm into a 1D algorithm. So instead of continueing bug hunting I’m going to switch to implementing MHD into Cholla.

Primarily I just unrolled the innermost loop over the x,y,z directions. This eliminated a bunch of complicated math using modulos to compute indices etc. Now it’s much cleaner and easier to maintain. This helped me find multiple errors in the VL+CT paper (Stone &amp;amp; Gard... </summary> </entry> </feed>
