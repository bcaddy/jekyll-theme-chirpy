# Astronomical Techniques
More discussion of error propagation. Started planning class projects and
discussed hypothesis testing.


# Numerical MHD
Still working on bug hunting. I tested a bunch of different things and finally
found the bug that was causing the \\( B_x \\) field to update. There was a
copy/paste error in the CT field calculations and I was using the wrong velocity
for one of the upwinding steps. My next step is going to be trying out simple
waves. I'll be using the wave tests from ATHENA++ which are detailed in
[Gardiner & Stone 2005](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501557). The initial conditions are given by

$$
    \vec{U} = \vec{\bar{U}} + A \vec{R_k} \cos\left(2\pi x\right).
$$

Where \\( \vec{U} \\) is the initial condition in conserved variables and
follows the usual density, momentum, magnetic field, energy ordering,
\\(\vec{\bar{U}} \\) is the constant background state that is being pertubed by
the wave, \\( A \\) is the amplitude of the wave/perturbation, \\( R_k \\) is
the right eigenvector and depends on the wave, and \\( x \\) is the position in
space. Magnetic fields will have to be implemented slightly differently than the
other components because they're at slightly different positions (cell faces
rather than centers). Here are the values of the parameters

$$
    A = 10^{-6}
$$

In primitive variable \\( \vec{\bar{U}} \\) is

$$
    \vec{\bar{U}}_{primitive} =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \rho \\
            P \\
            v_x \\
            v_y \\
            v_z \\
            B_x \\
            B_y \\
            B_z
         \end{bmatrix}
         =
         \begin{bmatrix}
            1 \\
            3/5 \\
            0 \text{(or 1 for the contact/entropy wave)} \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1 \\
            \sqrt{2} \\
            1/2
         \end{bmatrix}.
$$

\\( \vec{R}_k \\) for fast magnetosonic waves

$$
    \vec{R}_{\pm c_f} = \frac{1}{6\sqrt{5}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            6 \\
            \pm 12 \\
            \mp 4 \sqrt{2} \\
            \mp 2 \\
            0 \\
            8 \sqrt{2} \\
            4 \\
            27
         \end{bmatrix}.
$$


\\( \vec{R}_k \\) for slow magnetosonic waves

$$
    \vec{R}_{\pm c_s} = \frac{1}{6\sqrt{5}}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            12 \\
            \pm 6 \\
            \pm 8 \sqrt{2} \\
            \pm 4 \\
            0 \\
            -4 \sqrt{2} \\
            -2 \\
            9
         \end{bmatrix}.
$$

\\( \vec{R}_k \\) for Alfv√©n waves

$$
    \vec{R}_{\pm c_a} = \frac{1}{3}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \pm 1 \\
            \mp 2\sqrt{2} \\
            0 \\
            -1 \\
            2 \sqrt{2} \\
            0
        \end{bmatrix}.
$$

\\( \vec{R}_k \\) for contact/entropy waves, make sure to set \\( v_x=1 \\) in
\\( \vec{\bar{U}} \\) for this wave,

$$
    \vec{R}_{\pm c_a} = \frac{1}{2}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            2 \\
            2 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1
        \end{bmatrix}.
