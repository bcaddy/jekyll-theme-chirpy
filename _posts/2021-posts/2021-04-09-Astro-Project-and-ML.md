# Astronomical Techniques
In class over the last two weeks we've discussed basics of machine learning and
non-parametric tests.

We also started our class projects in earnest. My part so far has been to figure
out data ingestion and how to convert from simulation units to physical units.
This took longer than expected but I think I've got it figured out now.


# Big Data and Machine Learning Workshop
I attended XSEDE's *Big Data and Machine Learning* workshop given by the staff a
the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC). It was a two day truly excellet
workshop that provided and intro to Spark and various machine learning
algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors, Alternating Least Squares, neural nets
(including deep learning, convolutional neural nets, etc.). It was a really
great workshop, as are all the PSC/XSEDE workshops and I highly recommend it.
The recorded lectures can be found [on their youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/XSEDETraining/featured), though at the time
of writing the most current Big Data and ML workshop is not yet posted.

# MHD Debugging
I implemented the single wave initial conditions I discussed in [Classes and
Bugfixing 6]({% post_url 2021-posts/2021-03-19-Classes-and-bugfixing-6 %}). Currently the
contact discontinuity appears to work except for some issues at the boundaries.
I'm not sure what that is yet as the periodic boundary conditions appear to be
ok, I need to check with a pure hydro wave to see if that works.
