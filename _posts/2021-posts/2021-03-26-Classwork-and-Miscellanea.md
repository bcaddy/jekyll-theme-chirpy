# General
This week I needed a break from debugging so I worked on a bunch of
miscellaneous tasks that have been on the backburner for awhile; the university
also had a 1 day break I also had some extra classwork so I worked on that.

# Astronomical Techniques
Lectures mostly hypothesis testing. I also watched the recorded lectures on
astronomical observing tools and techniques and the one on DESI data.

We started our term projects this week and had a long meeting about that
Thursday to hammer out some details. I worked on laying some groundwork for that
and learning about some of the tools we'll need to use; setting up a git repo
for the project and getting JupyterLab set up.


# Website
I took an afternoon to fix this website. GitHub updated the version of Ubuntu
their servers use and it broke the GitHub actions that build this site. While
the upstream repo did have a fix implemented unfortunately the author rewrote
all their commits awhile ago so I couldn't just make a quick pull request to
update my site. Instead I had to set up my site entirely from scratch again.
That took awhile, especially since the upstream repo has gotten some significant
new feature since my last pull and integrating them with the changes I had made
to the site wasn't trivial. After awhile though I got it all working again and
even changed how I was organizing posts so it should be easier for me to
navigate and write posts.
