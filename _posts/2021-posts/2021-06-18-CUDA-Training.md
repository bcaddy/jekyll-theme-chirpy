# Learning CUDA
I completed five more sections of the [OLCF CUDA Training
Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/), which leaves me with
just one more that I'll finish off next week.

# Testing
I contacted several other Frontier CAAR teams and have been talking about their
testing frameworks with them. I also met with Alwin to discuss testing.
