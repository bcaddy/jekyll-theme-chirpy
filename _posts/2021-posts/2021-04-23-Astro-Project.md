# Astronomical Techniques
This week in class we discussed maximum likelihood, regression, and information
criteria.

I was working a lot on the project this week. I implemented dimensionality
reduction using t-SNE, PCA, and ISOMAP for the purpose of visualization and
looking for clusters in the data. I also determined the Spearman Corrolatin
coefficients between all the different features of interest and made a pair plot
with all the features. We found strong evidence that there are no clusters
though there are some strong correlations. I learned a lot about using Pandas,
scipy, sk-learn, and Seaborn which are all things I've been meaning to work on
for awhile but haven't had the chance. Next week is finals week so I will likely
be mostly writing my final paper then prepping and giving a presentation about
this project.
