# Learning CUDA
I completed the rest of the [OLCF CUDA Training
Series](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/).

# Meetings and Summer School
The OLCF User Meeting was this week and the *Rensselaer Summer Program: Advanced
Cyberinfrastructure Training for Modeling Physical Systems* summer school
started. This week was the bootcamp that just went over some basic computational
skills.
